  "description": "The west side of the island is known for its luxurious resorts and beautiful West Bay beach. This tour is made for those who would like to explore the more developed end of the island. Spend time on the beach and stroll through West End village where there are plenty of small shops to find unique souvenirs. Of course your tour couldn't be complete without spending some time with some of our favorite land-loving animals including monkeys, sloths, and birds at the local animal sanctuary! During your drive, there will be plenty of photo opportunities and your guide will tell you about the island's history and culture. Get hungry along the way? No problem!

This end of the island is less commercialized and shows a lot more of the island's natural flora and the islanders' typical lifestyle. Take a trip through the shaded mangrove canals on a motorized canoe (known locally as a dory), make a stop in Punta Gorda to experience one of Roatan's most culturally rich communities.
