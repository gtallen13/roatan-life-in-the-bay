Next.js was choosen as the framework for this project because of its SSR technologies which would allow for better performance of the website. Mongo DB was implemented to store and fetch data for the website which allows us to make use of the dynamic routing capability from Next.js. 
A feature that I hope to implement in the future is allowing payments through PayPal for the merchandise that the store has to offer.
This project is based of the [official website](https://www.roatanlifeinthebay.com/) of Roatan Life in the Bay which was developed by Luke Johnson. 
NOTE: This project was made for educational purposes only.
